<h2>Walk-through Summary:</h2>

 <h3>R Programming</h3>
R programming is a robust software tool for data analysis and visualization. In my project, I started by importing data into R from https://posit.cloud/ and performing data cleaning tasks. Leveraging the capabilities of R, I extracted various statistics and generated visualizations to gain insights from the data. I have included screenshots of my code and visualizations to showcase the analysis and visualization process. To see the entire markdown report, click this (TSLA Walkthrough.html) link

<h3>Presentation</h3>
I used Google Slides to create a presentation for showcasing the data. I have attached a couple of images for a quick review. While other visualization software may offer more visually appealing charts, I chose to include the R programming charts to demonstrate my proficiency in R programming.
